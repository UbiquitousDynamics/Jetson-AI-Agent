2025 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge
Regulations
Introduction and welcome
The biennial World Solar Challenge is owned by the Government of South Australia and managed
by the South Australian Motor Sport Board. Since 2013, Bridgestone Corporation has been the
naming rights sponsor of the event.
The aim of the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge is to stimulate research into, and development
of, energy efficient vehicle designs and technologies to support the global challenge to
decarbonise mobility. The Bridgestone World Solar Challenge is primarily a design competition
with the philosophy to provide the parameters on which to base the design, rather than specify
exactly how to build an energy efficient vehicle.
Revisions for the 18th edition retain the clear distinction between Challenger and Cruiser classes:
Challenger vehicles will be optimised for converting solar irradiance to speed; Cruiser vehicles
will be judged on practical design aspects as well as efficiency.
Significant changes from 2023 to 2025 include:
• shifting the date from October to August
• increased solar collector sizes and reduced energy storage allowances for Challenger
and Cruiser vehicles
• Cruiser vehicles may have three wheels
• energy storage measured by energy rather than mass
• easier-to-follow Cruiser format—fixed energy allowance, two occupants, single stage,
with incentives for sustainable, smart design features
• front and rear overhang restrictions, and new ground clearance requirements.
The information contained in this document is for the purposes of conducting the 2025
Bridgestone World Solar Challenge and must not be regarded as constituting definitive
instructions as to how a Competition Vehicle should be constructed or operated.
This document is organised as far as practical into the following sections:
• Administration
• Competition Vehicle Regulations
• The Adventure (Darwin and on-road protocols)
• Achievement and Celebration.
Additional information or clarification of the intent of regulations is included in italics.
The words WORLD SOLAR CHALLENGE and the SUN, FLAMES, RISING IN SEMI-CIRCLE image are registered

2 Competition Vehicle Regulations
2.1 Classes
2.1.1 The Event will have three classes of Competition Vehicle:
• Challenger class is for single-seat Competition Vehicles optimised for converting
solar irradiance to speed.
• Cruiser class is for Competition Vehicles with two or more seats that will be judged
on practical design features as well as efficiency.
• Explorer class is for Competition Vehicles designed to participate in previous Events
but not eligible for Challenger or Cruiser class, or other Competition Vehicles
approved by the Event Organiser. Explorer class is non-competitive.
2.1.2 Challenger vehicles must be powered by solar irradiance collected by the Competition
Vehicle. The only external energy input that may be used is the energy in the energy
storage system at the start of the Event.
2.1.3 Cruiser vehicles must be designed to be powered by renewable energy.
It is accepted that energy from regenerative braking, road gradients and wind incident on the Competition
Vehicle while driving may also be used. Active aerodynamic features are permitted but must not reduce the
stability of the vehicle. Cruiser Competition Vehicles must be designed to be powered by renewable energy
but may be recharged from non-renewable sources if renewable sources are not available.
2.2 Dimensions
2.2.1 When driving in a straight line, the Competition Vehicle must fit inside a right rectangular
prism 5800 mm long, 2300 mm wide and 1650 mm high, with the tyre contact points on
the base of the prism.
Standard 20’ shipping containers have 5880 mm internal length and 2350 mm internal width.
2.2.2 Cruiser vehicles must have a cargo compartment that can accommodate two items of
luggage, each 560 mm × 360 mm × 230 mm. The cargo space must be separated from
the Competition Vehicle mechanical or electrical systems.
2.3 Wheels
2.3.1 Competition Vehicles must be supported by at least three wheels while driving.
2.3.2 The longitudinal distance between the frontmost part of the Competition Vehicle and the
frontmost tyre contact point must be less than 60% of the wheelbase.
2.3.3 The longitudinal distance between the rearmost tyre contact point and the rearmost part
of the Competition Vehicle must be less than 60% of the wheelbase.
23
2.3.4 The fully laden Competition Vehicle must be able to drive over a road apex formed by a
1:15 incline followed by a 1:15 decline without any part of the vehicle other than the tyres
touching the road.
The length of the road apex will be greater than the wheelbase of the Competition Vehicle.
2.3.5 The fully laden Competition Vehicle must be able to drive over a speed hump with the
dimensions shown in the following diagram without any part of the vehicle, other than
the tyres, touching the speed hump.
2.3.6 The fully laden Competition Vehicle must have an approach angle of at least 10° and a
departure angle of at least 10°.
The Competition Vehicle must comply with all regulations in Section 2.3 whenever it is being driven.
2.4 Solar collector
2.4.1 Competition Vehicles may incorporate a solar collector that converts solar irradiation into
energy that can be used to propel the vehicle. The most common type of solar collector
for Competition Vehicles uses photovoltaic cells. Teams wishing to use other types of
solar collector must send details of their proposed solar collector to the Event Organiser
for approval.
2.4.2 A Challenger vehicle must not have more than 6.000 m2 of solar collector area. Solar
collector area includes:
• the directly exposed front surface area of all photovoltaic cells
• the directly exposed rear surface area of all bifacial photovoltaic cells
• the directly exposed surface area of energy conversion devices other than
photovoltaic cells
• the directly exposed area of all surfaces that transmit, refract or reflect light onto
devices that convert solar irradiation into energy that can be used to propel the
vehicle.
A surface is directly exposed if light can travel in a straight line from any part of the sky,
ground or road to the surface.
PV cell encapsulation within 10 mm of a minimum rectangle covering a PV cell will not
be counted towards the solar collector area.
The solar collector area limit applies to all possible configurations of the solar collector,
while driving and while solar charging.
24
Photovoltaic cell area includes active material, busbars, fingers, connection pads, and
cell area covered by interconnection ribbon or tabs.
If a bifacial photovoltaic array is tilted for solar charging so that the front and rear surfaces are both directly
exposed then the front and rear surface areas are both counted.
It is accepted that light reflection from parts of the Competition Vehicle such as the canopy is unavoidable.
Example area calculation: The area of a SunPower cell with a width of 125 mm and a diagonal diameter of
166 mm is less than 0.0155063 m2, and so 386 cells will have a total area less than 6.000 m2.
2.4.3 The solar collector area for Cruiser vehicles is unrestricted, but the solar collector must
be within the allowable dimensions of the Competition Vehicle.
2.4.4 Materials with high environmental toxicity, including GaAs, CdTe and CuInSe2, must not
be used for solar energy conversion.
2.4.5 All devices used for solar charging must be carried in the Competition Vehicle. This
includes stands, supports, and cables.
During solar charging, Competition Vehicles must not be tilted on jacks or stands that were not carried in the
vehicle even if you are pretending to change a wheel.
2.5 Energy storage
2.5.1 A Competition Vehicle may store energy. The most common type of energy storage for
Competition Vehicles is a rechargeable electrochemical battery. Teams wanting to use
energy storage technologies other than rechargeable electrochemical batteries must
send details of their proposed energy storage system to the Event Organiser for
approval.
2.5.2 Energy storage capacity must be no more than:
• 11 MJ for Challenger vehicles
• 55 MJ for Cruiser vehicles.
The energy storage capacity of electrochemical cells will be based on specifications
endorsed by the cell manufacturer. The nominal energy of a cell, in joules, will be
calculated by
𝐸𝐸 = 3600 𝑉𝑉 𝑞𝑞
where 𝑉𝑉 is the nominal discharge voltage of the cell, in volts, specified by the
manufacturer, and 𝑞𝑞 is the maximum of the:
• rated discharge capacity
• minimum discharge capacity
• typical or nominal discharge capacity, in Ah, specified by the manufacturer.
The energy storage capacity for other forms of energy storage will be determined by the
Chief Energy Scientist and will be based on energy that can be delivered from the ‘tank’.
25
The remaining regulations in this section are based on electrochemical energy storage. The Event Organiser
will require that alternative energy storage systems meet equivalent levels of safety based on the organiser’s
assessment of the proposal submitted by the Team.
2.5.3 Specifications from third party suppliers or found on the internet might not match those
endorsed by manufacturers. If the Event Organiser receives conflicting or unclear
specifications of electrochemical cell energy for a cell model, the Chief Energy Scientist
will determine the nominal cell energy for cells of that model.
2.5.4 The energy storage system must be contained within at most two packs. Energy storage
packs must be rigid, self-contained boxes that cannot be opened or disassembled
without using tools and can be removed from the Competition Vehicle intact.
2.5.5 Electrochemical cells must not, at any time, be operated outside of the operating ranges
for voltage, current and temperature specified by the manufacturer. Teams must provide
manufacturer’s specifications that include:
• minimum operating cell voltage
• maximum operating cell voltage
• maximum discharge current
• maximum charge current
• maximum temperature while discharging
• minimum temperature while charging
• maximum temperature while charging.
2.5.6 The Competition Vehicle must automatically prevent electrochemical cells from being
operated outside the operating ranges for voltage, current and temperature specified by
the manufacturer. Teams must provide endorsement by their certifying engineer that an
adequate and effective automatic battery management system has been designed and
implemented so that fault conditions will be managed safely.
2.5.7 Batteries used only to
• power a real-time clock when the Competition Vehicle is turned off; or
• retain data when the Competition Vehicle is turned off; or
• power wireless tyre pressure monitors
are not considered to be part of the energy storage system, provided that the total energy
capacity does not exceed 10 kJ.
2.5.8 Batteries or cells inside devices such as handheld radios, cameras, mobile telephones,
or wristwatches that are carried by the driver or passengers are not considered to be
part of the energy storage system if they are not electrically connected to the Competition
Vehicle, its instrumentation or control systems.
2.5.9 If a commercial-off-the-shelf phone or tablet containing a battery is used as a driver
display, it must be powered from the Competition Vehicle’s electrical system. The
electrical connection must be done in such a way that power cannot flow from the device
back into the Competition Vehicle. The blocking diode or other system used to achieve
26
this must be mounted within 200 mm of the device. The device must not be charged from
an external power source during the Event. The device’s battery capacity will be counted
as part of the energy storage capacity. The device will not be considered to be an energy
storage pack.
It is recognised that failure of the blocking device could result in 5 V being present throughout the Competition
Vehicle even in safe state. This is acceptable as long as:
a) the team can demonstrate that such a failure is highly improbable and
b) that in the event of such a failure, no combination of additional failures can prevent the Competition
Vehicle from entering safe state.
2.5.10 Capacitors are not considered to be part of the energy storage system if their total energy
storage capacity is less than 36 kJ. Any such capacitors that are outside the energy
storage packs or solar collector must be automatically discharged to less than 60 V within
five seconds of the Competition Vehicle being placed in safe state (see Regulation 2.28).
2.5.11 Energy storage packs must be mounted in the Competition Vehicle so that they will be
restrained in a 20 g acceleration in any direction.
2.5.12 The Competition Vehicle must be designed so that no liquids or gases from energy
storage packs can enter the occupant space.
2.5.13 Energy storage packs must be constructed so that each pack can be sealed using
tamper-evident plastic seals, like 3 × 100 mm plastic cable ties. With seals fitted, it must
not be possible to remove any cell without breaking the seal. Seals will be provided by,
and fitted by, the Event Organiser at Scrutineering.
2.5.14 Energy storage packs for Challenger vehicles must have a means of being sealed so
that no electrical connection can be made to the energy storage packs. The seals will be
tamper-evident plastic seals, like 3 × 100 mm plastic cable ties. Seals will be provided
by Observers.
This regulation allows teams to have the energy storage system impounded inside the Competition Vehicle.
Examples of acceptable sealing mechanisms include:
• disconnecting each energy storage pack from the rest of the Competition Vehicle and sealing a cover
over each pack that prevents access to all electrical connectors and to the inside of the pack
• removing the energy storage packs from the Competition Vehicle and sealing them in a box provided
by the team.
2.5.15 Energy storage packs must be in ‘safe state’ while being removed from the Competition
Vehicle and while being reinstalled into the Competition Vehicle.
2.5.16 Energy storage packs must be designed and constructed so that scrutineers can verify
the cell models being used and the number of cells of each model.
2.5.17 Any external charging system that is used to recharge an electrical energy storage
system must meet the following requirements:
• the charger must be used with a residual current device
27
• the charger must be either permanently connected to the energy storage system, or
connect to the energy storage system using an appropriate connector
• the output of the charger must be electrically isolated from any ac input
• charging must stop automatically when the energy storage system is full or if a fault
occurs.
This regulation applies to all charging done in Australia, including in the pits at Event Headquarters.
2.6 Cruiser recharging
2.6.1 Cruiser vehicles may be recharged from an external energy source overnight, during
the time intervals between when the team stops driving each day and when it starts
driving the next day.
2.6.2 Each Cruiser Team is responsible for providing the equipment required to recharge their
Competition Vehicle.
Teams requiring electricity to recharge could hire a room or powered camp site if they have stopped in a
town or at a roadhouse, or else recharge using an energy source supplied by the team.
2.6.3 Battery swapping (or the equivalent for other types of energy storage) is not permitted.
2.7 Vehicle identification and signage
2.7.1 The Competition Vehicle must have a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) permanently
attached to a substantial part of the vehicle chassis or frame. Teams may apply for a VIN
in their own country or else generate a ‘surrogate’ VIN with the format.
6ZZysssssssssssss
where y indicates the year of manufacture (N = 2022, P = 2023, R = 2024, S = 2025)
and sssssssssssss is 13 characters using digits 0–9 and uppercase letters A–Z but not
the letters I, O or Q, that includes a manufacturer code and a vehicle serial number, e.g.,
6ZZSW0MBATS0LAR01.
2.7.2 The Competition Vehicle must have a space at least 220 mm wide and at least 110 mm
high for mounting a rear vehicle registration plate. Whenever the Competition Vehicle is
being driven:
• the registration plate must be mounted in a vertical plane with its longest edge
horizontal and perpendicular to the direction of travel
• the letters must be upright
• the registration plate must be within 50 mm of the rearmost part of the Competition
Vehicle
• no part of the Competition Vehicle may be in the region rearward of the registration
plate in the range 15° up, 0° down, 45° left and 45° right from all parts of the
registration plate.
2.7.3 You must not modify the registration plate.
28
You must not enlarge the holes in the registration plate. You must not use the existing holes for rear vision.
2.7.4 Competition Vehicles must incorporate Event signage in unbroken rectangular spaces
200 mm high and 500 mm wide on both the left and the right sides of the vehicle. Artwork
will be available from the Event Team Portal.
‘Unbroken’ means that the signage space must not overlap panel gaps or visible joints.
Stickers will be provided to teams requiring the signage. Incorrect use of artwork will result in a sticker of the
correct size and with the correct artwork being applied.
2.7.5 Teams must display their 2-digit team number on the left and the right sides of the
Competition Vehicle, in digits that are more than 150 mm high and that are clearly visible
against their background.
2.7.6 Event signage and Team numbers must be completely visible from 3 m perpendicular to
the side of the Competition Vehicle and at a viewing height of 1.8 m above the ground.
2.7.7 Competition Vehicles must have an unbroken front signage area on the vehicle body,
forward of the windscreen. The front signage area must contain:
• the name of the Competition Vehicle, or the name of the Team, or the number of the
Competition Vehicle, readable at 3 m perpendicular to the centre of the name
• a 150 × 150 mm square Event logo.
The entire front signage area must be visible in top view and in front elevation view and
must not overlap with the solar collector. Artwork or a sticker for the Event logo will be
provided by the Event Organiser.
2.7.8 The national flag of the country of entry (as confirmed by the Event Organiser in line with
Regulation 1.20.2) must be displayed on the Competition Vehicle, adjacent to the
windscreen. Minimum height is 40 mm. The flag must not be broken.
Flags will be included on Event and vehicle signage for recognised countries only, as per
DFAT protocols.
2.8 Ballast
2.8.1 Each Challenger and Cruiser vehicle occupant will be assigned ballast so that the
combined mass of the occupant and their ballast is at least 80 kg.
Explorer class Team occupants need not carry ballast and will not be weighed.
Occupants will have their ballast checked by the Team’s Observer outside the Competition Vehicle. All
ballast must be removed from the Competition Vehicle at control stops.
2.8.2 Ballast will be supplied by the Event Organiser.
The approximate density of the ballast material is 5 kg per litre. Ballast provided by teams will not be
accepted.
2.8.3 Each occupant of Challenger and Cruiser vehicles must secure their ballast inside the
Competition Vehicle within 300 mm of their hip point.
29
2.9 Tracker and telemetry
2.9.1 The Competition Vehicle must have provision to carry a self-contained tracker provided
by the Event Organiser.
The tracker box will be 120 mm long, 120 mm wide and 70 mm high. The tracker will be self-powered. It will
not require any electrical connection from the Competition Vehicle. The mass of the tracker will not exceed
2 kg. It will emit radio frequency energy with no more power than emitted by a mobile phone. The unit will
be given to the Team for installation during Scrutineering.
2.9.2 When the tracker box is installed in the Competition Vehicle, it must be possible to
construct a right circular cone with its axis perpendicular to the top face of the box and
an apex angle of 120°, and with the cone touching each edge of the top face of the box,
so that no ray from the apex and within the cone passes through the ground or through
any part of the Competition Vehicle that is not radio transparent at frequencies between
300 and 3000 MHz. The tracker box may be tilted within the Competition Vehicle.
Fibreglass and aramid composites, vinyl stickers, paint, clear acrylic and clear polycarbonate are radio
transparent if they do not include metal or carbon. Solar cells, carbon fibre composites and metal are not
considered radio transparent.
2.9.3 The tracker unit must be returned to the Event Organiser at the end of the Event.
2.9.4 Cruiser teams must upload telemetry data at each control stop and in Adelaide.
Challenger teams may choose to upload telemetry data at each control stop and in
Adelaide.
2.9.5 The telemetry data must include the following measurements taken at 10-second
intervals while driving and while charging:
• distance travelled
• longitude and latitude (if available)
• cumulative energy generated from the solar collector
• cumulative energy from the battery (increases when energy is taken from the battery,
decreases when the battery is charged)
• UTC time.
Details of data formats will be made available to registered teams.
2.9.6 Tracker and telemetry data will be published by the Event Organiser.
30
2.10 Safety
2.10.1 Teams are responsible for the safety and roadworthiness of their Competition Vehicles.
Compliance with the Regulations and passing Scrutineering does not mean that a
Competition Vehicle is safe, roadworthy, and fit for purpose.
2.10.2 Each Team must engage a professionally qualified certifying engineer to certify that the
Competition Vehicle is designed and constructed using sound engineering practice,
maintains stability while driving during testing, and is roadworthy and fit for being driven
from Darwin to Adelaide on public roads. The certifying engineer must be qualified to
report on the roadworthiness of vehicles for operation on public roads. They may consult
with other engineers.
In Australia, a certifying engineer must have a four-year bachelor’s degree or higher in mechanical or
automotive engineering, five years of postgraduate experience working in the automotive industry, and
professional indemnity and public liability insurance. Other jurisdictions will have similar requirements.
2.10.3 Any changes made after certification to items described in the roadworthiness certificate
must be re-approved by the Team’s certifying engineer.
2.10.4 All parts of the Competition Vehicle must be fixed so that they cannot detach while
driving. Latched parts such as doors, canopies and top shells must be secured with twostage latches where the first stage engages easily and is sufficient to hold the part if the
second stage is not engaged properly.
2.11 Occupant cell
2.11.1 Competition Vehicle occupants must be enclosed in an occupant cell designed to protect
them from injury.
2.11.2 Vehicle components within the occupant cell must be designed to minimise the risk of
injury or entrapment in a crash.
2.11.3 Teams must provide documentation that specifies which parts of their Competition
Vehicle constitute the occupant cell.
2.11.4 When occupants are seated normally, with safety-belts and helmets on, they must be
completely inside the convex hull of the occupant cell.
2.11.5 There must be a gap of at least 50 mm between every point on every occupant’s helmet
and the convex hull of the occupant cell.
Imagine stretching a rubber skin around the occupant cell; occupants must be completely inside the skin,
and helmets must be more than 50 mm from the skin.
31
2.11.6 Each Team must provide a description of how the occupant cell will protect the occupants
from impacts including frontal impacts, side impacts, rollover impacts, bottom impacts
and wheel impacts. This description must be endorsed by the Team’s certifying engineer.
For analysis of the occupant cell, the minimum test loads are:
• frontal impact: a 5 g load, opposing the direction of travel, applied to the front of the
occupant cell in an area less than 250 mm high and less than 600 mm wide
• side impact: a 5 g load into the side of the occupant cell, applied adjacent to the
driver’s torso in an area less than 250 mm high and less than 600 mm wide
• top impact: a load with components 5 g down, 1.5 g sideways and 4 g backwards,
applied at each possible area of contact between the occupant cell and the ground
when the occupant cell is upside down; the contact area for each test load must have
a diameter less than 150 mm
2.11.7 The occupant cell must be designed to protect each occupant’s head, arms and upper
torso by deflecting objects such as body panels and fencing wires away from the
occupant. The structure used to achieve this must extend to the top of the occupant cell
and be capable of resisting or deflecting loads of 5 g applied to it from any horizontal
direction by a horizontal object 2.3 m wide and less than 250 mm high.
It is permissible for the windscreen to break provided the occupants are protected.
Regulation 2.16.2 defines the maximum obscuration of the driver’s vision by A-pillars.
2.11.8 Loads in Regulations 2.11.6 and 2.11.7 are based on the fully laden mass of the
Competition Vehicle. Teams must be able to show that the occupant cell structure will
not fail with these test loads, that any deformations as a result of these loads will not
impinge on the occupants, and that risks of impacts of the occupants with the interior of
the Competition Vehicle are minimised.
2.12 Seats
2.12.1 Challenger vehicles must have one seat. Cruiser vehicles must have at least two seats.
Cruiser vehicles must have two occupants while driving.
2.12.2 Each Competition Vehicle occupant must have a seat that faces forwards. The driver’s
legs, viewed from above, must be within 10° of the forwards direction.
32
2.12.3 Each seat must have a back, and a head restraint that is behind the occupant’s head.
The distance from the hip point to the top of the head restraint at the lateral centreline of
the seat must be at least 800 mm for front seats and at least 750 mm for Cruiser vehicle
rear seats (UNECE Regulations 17 and 25). The hip point may be approximated as
shown in the diagram below.
You may use different cushions for different drivers. The full set of cushions will be considered part of the
Competition Vehicle and must be carried in the Competition Vehicle.
2.12.4 An Event manikin (‘PVC Pat’) must fit into the driver’s seat and any passenger seat that
will be occupied during the Event. Dimensioned drawings of the manikin are available on
the Event website.
PVC Pat’s dimensions are based on 95th percentile international male and female dimensions from the
DINED anthropometric database.
2.12.5 When seated in the normal seating position, PVC Pat must be protected by the occupant
cell (Regulation 2.11), with the exception that PVC Pat does not have to wear a helmet
(Regulation 2.11.4).
2.12.6 PVC Pat does not have to meet the vision requirements.
2.12.7 Each occupant’s heels, including PVC Pat’s heels, must be below their hip point.
2.12.8 The outer edges of PVC Pat’s ankles must be 436 mm apart, as shown in the drawing.
The outer edges of PVC Pat’s wrist’s must be able to be placed 496 mm apart.
2.12.9 The angle between PVC Pat’s shoulder, hip and knees must be more than 90°.
2.12.10 PVC Pat’s head can tilt forwards, but no more than 30° from the line of the spine. PVC
Pat’s head does not yaw.
2.12.11 PVC Pat, or a person no smaller than PVC Pat, must be able to get in and out of the
normal seating positions. You may remove PVC Pat’s legs, temporarily, to help get the
torso and head into position.
2.12.12 PVC Pat’s hip point must be in the same position as the hips of an actual driver in the
normal driving position, or an actual passenger in the normal seated position.
33
2.12.13 Head space for each seat must comply with Section LK of the Australian National Code
of Practice for Light Vehicle Construction and Modification, as shown in the following
diagram. The 835 mm radius arm must be able to move 45° forwards, 25° backwards
and 7° either side of vertical. The steering wheel, mirrors, seat backs and head restraints
may be inside the head space but must be designed to minimise the risk of injury in a
crash. No other part of the Competition Vehicle structure, including the windscreen, may
be inside the head space.
This minimum head space requirement is based on a 50-percentile male and does not allow for a helmet.
Taller team members may need more head space.
2.13 Safety-belts
2.13.1 Safety-belts must be fitted for each seating position. Safety-belts must be compliant with
at least one of the following standards: UNECE Regulation 16, US FMVSS 571.209,
SFI 16.1, SFI 16.5, SFI 16.6, FIA 8853-2016, FIA 8854/98.
The occupant cell will provide the greatest protection when occupants are secured into the cell with fourpoint or five-point harnesses.
2.13.2 Safety-belts must be fitted and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, or as
approved by the Team’s certifying engineer.
2.13.3 Safety-belt anchorages must meet the intent of UNECE Regulation 14. In particular:
• upper anchorages for each seat must withstand a force of 13.5 kN applied to the
upper safety-belt straps
• lower anchorages for each seat must withstand a force of 13.5 kN applied to the lower
safety-belt straps
• the location of anchor points must comply with the instructions of the safety-belt
manufacturer, or with UNECE Regulation 14 Annex 3.
2.13.4 Compliance must be confirmed by the Team’s certifying engineer.
34
2.14 Egress
2.14.1 Teams must demonstrate that all occupants can exit the Competition Vehicle in less than
15 seconds, without assistance.
2.14.2 Doors and canopies used for egress must be capable of being secured and released
from inside the Competition Vehicle and from outside the Competition Vehicle.
2.14.3 Emergency openings, and the methods of opening, must be clearly indicated on the
exterior of the Competition Vehicle, and be visible and achievable by an emergency
services first responder not familiar with the Competition Vehicle.
Instructions may include diagrams.
2.14.4 Occupants must be able to exit the Competition Vehicle without assistance at any time.
Teams must not use adhesive tape to secure exits.
2.15 Ventilation, cooling, and hydration
2.15.1 The Competition Vehicle must have sufficient ventilation to prevent the build-up of CO2
in the cabin. Occupants must have ventilation or cooling sufficient to ensure that they will
not overheat. The Team must describe the ventilation and cooling systems and have
them approved by their certifying engineer.
2.15.2 Each Competition Vehicle must have space for at least two litres of drinking water for
each occupant (see Regulation 3.23.3).
2.16 Forward and sideward vision
2.16.1 Each driver, when seated in the normal driving position with safety-belt and helmet on,
must be able to identify 75 mm high letters at every point of forward travel that is:
• 4 m from the driver’s eyes, and
• between 0.4 m below eye level and 0.7 m above eye level, and
• between 100° left and 100° right of the direction of travel.
35
2.16.2 There must be no more than 2 pillars within the forward and sideward field of view. Each
pillar must obscure less than 6° of the horizontal field of view.
2.16.3 Forward and sideward vision must be achieved without the aid of mirrors, lenses, or
electronic vision systems.
2.16.4 The windscreen that is used for forward and sideward vision must have an optical
transmittance more than 75%.
2.16.5 Traffic light colours must be discernible through the windscreen.
2.17 Rear vision
2.17.1 The Competition Vehicle must have rear vision systems that enable the driver, when
seated in the normal driving position with the safety-belt fastened, to see the ground in
the shaded areas shown in the diagrams below (UNECE Regulation 46, Section 15).
36
2.17.2 Rear vision systems may be electronic, mirrors, or both. Rear vision systems must
operate whenever the Competition Vehicle is in motion under its own power or about to
be driven. Rear vision images must be upright and oriented so that objects on the right
of the Competition Vehicle are on the right of the image.
2.18 Steering
2.18.1 Steering must be controlled by a steering wheel designed so that it cannot catch on
clothing while driving or when the driver exits the Competition Vehicle.
2.18.2 Failure of any non-mechanical component of the steering system must not prevent
effective steering of the Competition Vehicle.
2.18.3 Steering shafts must be designed to reduce the risk of injury to the driver in a crash.
A collapsible boss is an acceptable method to reduce steering wheel impacts.
2.18.4 Spherical joints used in steering and suspension rod ends must be designed so that the
two joined parts cannot detach completely if the spherical joint fails.
2.18.5 Rear-wheel steering is not permitted. Specifically, no wheel that is rearward of the centre
of mass of the Competition Vehicle may be steered, either by a mechanism that the
driver operates or via a servo motor. This does not preclude suspension designs that are
deliberately designed to have built-in bump steer or roll steer.
2.18.6 The Competition Vehicle must be able to turn in each direction within a circle with a
radius of 7.5 metres, measured to the extreme outer edge of the tyre track at ground
level.
37
2.19 Stability
2.19.1 Competition Vehicles must be able to negotiate a Figure-8 course in less than 9 seconds
per side and less than 18 seconds overall, in all driving configurations.
2.19.2 Competition Vehicles must be able to negotiate a slalom course in less than 11.5
seconds, in all driving configurations.
2.19.3 The Competition Vehicle must be stable at all achievable speeds and in crosswinds likely
to be encountered, in all driving configurations. Teams must provide analysis or test
results that show that the Competition Vehicle will be stable at high speeds and in
crosswinds. This analysis must be approved by the Team’s certifying engineer.
38
In 2019, at least six Competition Vehicles left the road when hit by strong wind gusts. Wind gusts exceeding
100 km/h are possible. Some of the factors affecting Competition Vehicle stability are presented in the
informal discussion paper by Prof John Storey, 'Stability Considerations’ V 2.0, available on the World Solar
Challenge website.
2.19.4 The fully laden Competition Vehicle should not tip when tilted by 45° about each pair of
adjacent tyre contact patches, in all driving configurations.
The Team’s certifying engineer must approve the stability and the rollover propensity of the Competition
Vehicle.
A tilt test is one way of testing the static stability factor (SSF) of a Competition Vehicle, which is one indication
of susceptibility to rollover. Notice that the Regulation says ‘should’ and not ‘must’. It is permissible to have
a Competition Vehicle that does not pass a static tilt test, provided that the Competition Vehicle has some
other mechanism for handling the equivalent forces without tipping. If the Competition Vehicle cannot pass
a tilt test in all suspension configurations it becomes particularly important that the certifying engineer be
satisfied with the roll-over stability under all conditions. Their certification documentation should provide a
summary of analysis and testing you have done.
2.20 Brakes
Braking requirements are based on UNECE Regulation 13-H.
2.20.1 The braking system must be approved by the Team’s certifying engineer.
2.20.2 The Competition Vehicle must be equipped with a service braking system that enables
the driver to control the Competition Vehicle and bring it to a halt without removing either
hand from the steering control.
2.20.3 The Competition Vehicle must be equipped with a secondary braking system, operated
by the same control as the service braking system, that the driver can use to control the
Competition Vehicle to a halt if the service braking system suffers any single failure.
The service braking system in a conventional vehicle is controlled by a brake pedal that operates two
independent hydraulic brake circuits. One possible configuration has the front wheels on one circuit and the
rear wheels on the other. An alternative configuration has a circuit for each diagonal pair of wheels. These
arrangements meet the requirements for service and secondary braking systems—the service system
operates both hydraulic circuits, and the secondary system operates whichever circuit has not failed.
2.20.4 Service and secondary braking systems may share components deemed ‘not liable to
failure’ if they are amply dimensioned and readily accessible for maintenance.
Components ‘not liable to failure’ are:
• a brake pedal and its bearing
• hydraulic cylinders and their pistons
• hydraulic control valves
• brake cylinders and their pistons
• brake lever and cam assemblies.
2.20.5 Hydraulic brake hoses and lines are regarded as liable to failure.
2.20.6 The service braking system must apply braking effort to all road wheels.
39
2.20.7 Braking must not cause the Competition Vehicle to yaw. This requirement applies to both
the service braking system and the secondary braking system.
2.20.8 For Competition Vehicles without anti-lock brakes, the front wheels must lock up before
the rear wheels.
2.20.9 The service braking system must be able to stop the fully laden Competition Vehicle
within distance
0.1 v + 0.0060 v2
metres from any speed v, in km/h, that the vehicle can achieve, with minimum
regenerative braking.
If regenerative braking is disabled when the energy storage system is full then the service braking test must
be done with no regenerative braking.
2.20.10 If the service braking system has a failure, the secondary braking system must be able
stop the fully laden Competition Vehicle, with no regenerative braking, within distance
0.1 v + 0.0158 v2
metres from any speed v, in km/h, that the vehicle can achieve.
Braking the single rear wheel of trike, for example, might not provide sufficient braking force.
2.20.11 Competition Vehicles must be equipped with a parking brake that can be operated by
the driver from the normal driving position. The parking brake must hold the fully laden
Competition Vehicle on a 20% incline or decline.
2.21 Tyres
2.21.1 Tyres must be suitable for highway use and used in accordance with their manufacturer’s
recommendations always.
2.21.2 Competition Vehicles must be fitted with tyres that are:
• compliant with UNECE Regulation 30, UNECE Regulation 75 or US FMVSS 571.109,
as indicated by an E or DOT approval marking on the tyre; or
• otherwise approved by the Event Organiser.
Experimental or prototype tyres must be approved by the Australian road traffic authorities. The Event
Organiser will administer this process, which requires the tyre manufacturer to submit a sample tyre and
written technical specifications to the Event Organiser’s office not later than 25 April 2025. A positive
outcome to the approval process, which may take up to three months, is not guaranteed.
2.21.3 The speed rating of the tyres must be more than the maximum speed of the Competition
Vehicle. The load rating of each tyre must be more than the maximum static load
imposed on it by the fully laden Competition Vehicle.
2.21.4 Tyres must be approved by the Team’s certifying engineer.
2.21.5 Tyres must be free of any apparent defect.
40
2.22 Driving and reversing
2.22.1 The fully laden Competition Vehicle must be able to start from rest on a 7% gradient.
2.22.2 The Competition Vehicle must be able to be driven backwards under its own power with
the driver seated in the normal position.
2.23 Lighting
2.23.1 Competition Vehicles must be fitted with:
• two rear stop lamps
• one central stop lamp
• left and right front direction indicator lamps
• left and right-side direction indicator lamps
• left and right rear direction indicator lamps
• two daytime running lamps.
Headlamps and tail lamps are not required, though would increase the practicality of Cruiser vehicles.
2.23.2 Stop lamps must emit red light. Direction indicator lamps must emit amber light. Daytime
running lamps must emit white light.
If you are designing your own lamps, then you must show that your lamp colours conform to the chromaticity
requirements described in UNECE Regulation 48.
2.23.3 Lamps must be compliant with UNECE Regulation 148 or the SAE/DOT equivalents.
Teams must demonstrate compliance by either:
• the presence of compliance markings on the lamps, or
• detailed documentation that demonstrates compliance with the photometric
requirements of the UNECE or SAE/DOT regulations, confirmed by the Team’s
certifying engineer.
Lamps approved for motorcycles and side marker lamps might not meet these requirements.
Photometric requirements for lamps are listed in Appendix 3 of UNECE Regulation 148. You may
demonstrate compliance by testing or by calculations. If you are using calculations, be aware that most LEDs
do not emit the same intensity at every angle, so the simple formula for converting luminous flux (lumens)
to luminous intensity (candelas) does not apply.
2.23.4 Competition Vehicles must have the correct type of lamp in each position. Lamps must
be mounted with the correct orientation so that the photometric requirements of UNECE
Regulation 148 or the SAE/DOT equivalents are met.
Lamp UNECE category SAE/DOT type
Front indicators 1, 1a, 1b I3, I4, I5
Rear indicators 2a, 2b I6
41
Side indicators 5, 6 E2
Stop lamps S1, S2 S
Central stop lamp S3 U3
Daytime running lamp RL Y2
Lamp position and visibility requirements are based on UNECE Regulation 48. ‘Apparent surface’ is defined
in the glossary and in UNECE Regulation 48.
2.23.5 The rear stop lamps must meet the following position and visibility requirements:
• for each of the left and right stop lamps, the lateral distance between the outer edge
of the apparent lamp surface and the corresponding outer edge of the Competition
Vehicle must be not more than 400 mm
• the minimum lateral distance between the apparent surfaces of the two stop lamps
must be at least 600 mm, or at least 400 mm if the Competition Vehicle is less than
1300 mm wide
• the lowest point on the apparent surface of each stop lamp must be at least 350 mm
above the ground
• the entire apparent surface of each lamp must be visible from every point in the region
between the planes 15° up, 5° down, and 45° to the left and right.
2.23.6 A central stop lamp is required. Viewed from behind the Competition Vehicle, the lateral
position of the lamp must coincide with the visual centre of the Competition Vehicle (see
the examples in the following diagram). The lowest point on the apparent surface must
be higher than a point 150 mm below the rear windscreen if the Competition Vehicle has
a rear windscreen, and the bottom of the apparent surface of the lamp must be higher
than the top of the apparent surface of the rear stop lamps. The entire apparent surface
must be visible from every point in the region between the planes 10° up, 5° down and
10° to the left and right.
2.23.7 The following position requirements apply to the left and right front indicator lamps and
to the left and right rear indicator lamps:
• for each of the left and right indicator lamps, the lateral distance between the outer
edge of the apparent lamp surface and the corresponding outer edge of the vehicle
must be not more than 400 mm
• the minimum lateral distance between the inner edges of the apparent surfaces of the
left and right indicator lamps must be at least 600 mm, or at least 400 mm if the
Competition Vehicle is less than 1300 mm wide
42
• the lowest point on the apparent surface of each indicator lamp must be at least
350 mm above the ground.
2.23.8 Side direction indicator lamps must be less than 1800 mm behind the front most part of
the Competition Vehicle, and the outer edge of each apparent surface must be within
400 mm of the extreme outer edge of the Competition Vehicle on each side.
2.23.9 The entire apparent surface of each front and rear direction indicator lamp must be visible
from every point in the region between the planes 15° up, 5° down, 45° inboard and 80°
outboard (see the diagram below, which shows the horizontal angles for the right
indicators).
2.23.10 The entire apparent surface of each side indicator must be visible from every point in the
region between the planes 15° up, 5° down, 5° outboard and 65° outboard (see the
diagram below).
2.23.11 Direction indicators must flash at 90±30 flashes per minute.
2.23.12 It must be possible to flash the left and right direction indicator lamps simultaneously, as
a hazard warning signal.
2.23.13 Daytime running lamps must be mounted at the front of the Competition Vehicle so that:
• the minimum lateral distance between the apparent surfaces of the lamps is at least
600 mm, or at least 400 mm if the Competition Vehicle is less than 1300 mm wide
• the lowest point on each apparent surface is at least 250 mm above the ground
• the entire apparent surface is visible from every point in the region between the planes
10° up, 10° down, 20° outwards and 20° inwards.
2.23.14 Headlamps (if fitted) must be at the front of the Competition Vehicle so that
• the lateral distance between outer edge of the apparent surface and the
corresponding outer edge of the Competition Vehicle is not more than 400 mm
• the minimum distance between the apparent surfaces is at least 600 mm, or at least
400 mm apart if the Competition Vehicle is less than 1300 mm wide
• the lowest point on each apparent surface is at least 500 mm above the ground
43
• each entire apparent surface is visible from every point in the region between the
planes 15° up, 10° down, 45° outwards and 10° inwards.
2.23.15 The stop lamps must operate whenever driving is possible, and the brakes are applied.
2.23.16 The daytime running lamps must operate whenever driving is possible.
2.24 Audible warning device
2.24.1 An audible warning device complying with the intent of UNECE Regulation 28 must be
fitted to the Competition Vehicle.
2.24.2 Sound pressure level must be more than LA = 105 dB measured 2 m from the horn.
The horn should be mounted so that Competition Vehicle occupants are not subjected to excessive sound
pressure levels.
A standard car horn is unlikely to achieve 105 dB if it is sealed inside the Competition Vehicle and not open
to the air outside the Competition Vehicle.
2.24.3 The device must emit a continuous and uniform sound. The audible warning device must
be capable of operating for 50,000 cycles of on for one second and off for four seconds.
2.25 Instrumentation
2.25.1 The following information must always be visible to the driver (i.e., not behind menus)
while the Competition Vehicle is in motion:
• the speed of the Competition Vehicle
• whether the direction indicators are operating
• whether the hazard lights are operating
• energy storage system warnings
• electronic rear vision images (if fitted).
2.25.2 This instrumentation must be powered from the energy storage system, and not from
separate batteries.
2.26 Automatic functions
2.26.1 Any cruise control function must automatically deactivate when the brake is operated, or
the Competition Vehicle is turned off.
Cruise control must not resume automatically following a brake operation.
2.26.2 Any automatic driving function must immediately deactivate on manual input or when the
Competition Vehicle is turned off.
Automatic driving must not resume automatically.
44
2.27 Electrical safety
Electrical safety requirements are based on Section 5 of UNECE Regulation 100. The term ‘high voltage’
means more than 60 V dc or more than 30 V rms ac.
2.27.1 Protection against direct contact with high-voltage parts, including conductors, must be
achieved using double insulation, enclosures, or barriers. It must not be possible to
remove protection without the use of tools.
2.27.2 Protection against direct contact with high-voltage parts inside the driver, passenger and
luggage compartments must be designed to exclude objects larger than 1 mm diameter
(Ingress Protection rating IPXXD).
2.27.3 Protection against direct contact with high-voltage parts inside areas other than the
driver, passenger and luggage compartments must be designed to exclude fingers
(Ingress Protection rating IPXXB).
2.27.4 Double insulation must meet the AS 3001/IEEE 100 definition: comprising both basic
insulation and independent supplementary insulation that provides protection equivalent
to that of the basic insulation. A single layer of reinforced insulation is also acceptable if
it provides protection equivalent to double insulation.
Electrical tape and flimsy, easily displaced covers are unlikely to meet the requirements of supplementary
insulation. The front surface of a photovoltaic cell is deemed to be double insulated if properly encapsulated.
The rear surface is deemed to be ‘live’ unless the team can demonstrate otherwise.
2.27.5 High-voltage energy storage packs must be marked with the high-voltage symbol shown
in the following diagram.
2.27.6 The high-voltage symbol must also be visible on any enclosure or barrier that can be
accessed without using tools, if removing the enclosure or barrier exposes high-voltage
parts.
Example: A motor controller contains high voltage parts, so these parts must be protected by an enclosure
or barrier that requires tools to remove (Regulation 2.27.1). If it is possible to touch the motor controller
enclosure without using tools (e.g., by opening the boot or tilting the solar collector) then the motor controller
enclosure must have a high-voltage symbol on it.
2.27.7 The resistance between any exposed conductive part and each terminal of the energy
storage system must exceed 100 V ohms, where V is the nominal voltage of the energy
storage system.
This is equivalent to a maximum leakage current of 10 mA.
2.27.8 The resistance between any exposed conductive part and each terminal of every solar
cell must exceed 100 V ohms, where V is the maximum circuit voltage of the solar
collector.
45
2.27.9 A system must be implemented to monitor the isolation of the Competition Vehicle’s
chassis and body as per Regulations 2.27.7 and 2.27.8. This system may take the form
of a permanently connected electronic device or a properly documented procedure of
regular manual checks.
2.27.10 A fuse or circuit breaker, suitably rated to protect the wiring, must be mounted in or on
each energy storage pack. Additionally, the dc interrupting current (i.e., dc breaking
current) capacity of the device must be able to interrupt the maximum possible shortcircuit current of the battery packs.
A typical Competition Vehicle might use a 50 A fuse with a 15000 A dc interrupt rating. Fuses and circuit
breakers intended for ac use might not meet this requirement. Teams must provide a manufacturer’s data
sheet clearly showing that the dc specifications of the device are adequate.
2.28 Safe state
The Regulations in this section are for a Competition Vehicle with a photovoltaic solar collector and
electrochemical energy storage. Teams using alternative solar collector or energy storage technologies must
ensure that their Competition Vehicle can be made safe in an emergency. The systems used to achieve this
must meet equivalent levels of safety based on the organiser’s assessment of the proposal submitted by the
entrant.
2.28.1 The Competition Vehicle must have a ‘safe state’ which, in an emergency, minimises the
risk of fire and electric shock to occupants, team members, emergency response
personnel, and bystanders. When in the safe state:
• Every conductor emerging from each energy storage pack must be galvanically
isolated from every energy storage cell. This means that there must be a contactor in
series with the negative pole of the battery and a second contactor in series with the
positive pole, in each energy storage pack.
• No voltage may be present across any pair of conductors emerging from any energy
storage pack.
• No voltage may be present across any pair of conductors emerging from any solar
collector. This isolation must be performed with a contactor, which must be mounted
on the same structural component as the solar collector it is associated with.
• All contactors described above must immediately and automatically open when safe
state is invoked.
• No current may be present through any conductor loop that is external to the energy
storage packs or the solar collectors.
MOSFETS and other semiconductor devices are not considered to offer galvanic isolation.
Safe state is for emergencies and for complete shutdown of the Competition Vehicle. In addition to safe
state, a Competition Vehicle may have a ‘standby’ state that provides power to some subsystems outside of
the energy storage packs.
2.28.2 Any part of any conductor that is more than 200 mm from the nearest PV cell is
considered to be outside of the solar collector.
This Regulation applies regardless of the solar collector voltage. Emergency first responders are told that
any wiring within 200 mm of a PV cell may be live when the Competition Vehicle is in safe state, and no
wiring more than 200 mm from a PV cell will be live when the Competition Vehicle is in safe state.
46
2.28.3 All mechanisms for placing the Competition Vehicle into safe state and maintaining safe
state must be fail-safe; if an electrical activation mechanism fails, the Competition
Vehicle must automatically and immediately place itself into safe state and must remain
in safe state until there is a deliberate intervention by the Team.
2.28.4 The safe state circuit must be designed to be as simple and direct as possible. In
particular, it must be designed in such a way that failure of a semiconductor device or
devices, no matter how improbable, cannot:
• prevent the Competition Vehicle from entering safe state when the activation device
is operated, or
• bring the Competition Vehicle out of safe state without deliberate driver intervention.
2.28.5 The driver must be able to place the Competition Vehicle into safe state with a single
simple action while seated in the normal driving position and without releasing the safetybelt. This activation device must be clearly labelled.
2.28.6 For emergency use, an activation device that operates with a single simple action that
immediately places the Competition Vehicle into safe state must be provided on the
exterior of the Competition Vehicle. Multiple activations must not bring the Competition
Vehicle out of safe state. The activation device must be placed within a yellow disc with
a diameter of 180 mm. Also, in the yellow disk must be a blue equilateral triangle
(minimum side length 150 mm) that contains a red flash, with the legend Emergency
Electrical Isolation. In addition, there must be a clear instruction on how to operate the
device (e.g., PULL or PRESS). The yellow isolation disc and the activation mechanism
must be clearly visible to an emergency services first responder approaching the driver
and must be within 100 mm of the lower edge of the windscreen, adjacent to the driver
egress opening. No part of the yellow disc may be behind the driver.
Both activation mechanisms must be demonstrated at Static Scrutineering. The scrutineers may invite
random members of the public to validate the ease of operation of the external emergency activation device.
47
3 The Adventure
3.1 Supervision
3.1.1 The Clerk of the Course is responsible for supervising on-road activities.
3.1.2 During on-road activities, communication with the Clerk of the Course must be made
through Mission Control.
3.2 Safety
3.2.1 The Team Safety Officer is responsible for the general safety of the Team.
3.2.2 The Team Battery Officer is responsible for the safe operation of the energy storage
system and for supervising response to any energy storage system emergency.
3.2.3 Energy storage system incident response kits must be readily available to the
Competition Vehicle and any other vehicle carrying Competition Vehicle energy storage
systems.
3.2.4 A Team member with a recognised first-aid certificate, current for the duration of the
Event, must travel in the front or rear escort vehicle.
3.2.5 It is the responsibility of each Team to ensure that the vehicles under its control are
maintained in a safe, roadworthy condition and are operated safely and within the law
always.
3.2.6 All Competition Vehicles and escort vehicles are operated and driven at the Team’s own
risk.
3.2.7 The Clerk of the Course may exclude any Team from the Event at any time if any Team
member operates a Competition Vehicle or any other vehicle in an unsafe manner.
3.2.8 Teams must look after the health and safety of their team members and Observer.
Fatigue and dehydration are serious hazards in this Event. This is especially relevant to drivers, particularly
those of Competition Vehicles.
3.2.9 Drivers, Team members, officials and Observers are to be drug free and maintain a blood
alcohol level less than 0.01% whilst engaged in any duties associated with the Event.
3.3 Safety-belts
3.3.1 The use of safety-belts is mandatory for all occupants of motor vehicles in Australia,
including Competition Vehicles.
48
3.4 Helmets
3.4.1 Each occupant of a Competition Vehicle must wear an approved motorcycle helmet
securely fitted and fastened in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
3.4.2 Motorcycle helmets must have a mark certifying compliance with either:
• Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 1698:2006
• United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulation No 22 (UNECE 22.05
or 22.06).
3.4.3 Helmets must not be modified, have unauthorised attachments, or be used in any way
contrary to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3.5 Safety equipment
3.5.1 Suitable and appropriate safety equipment must be carried always. The minimum safety
equipment that must be carried in the rear escort vehicle is:
• a first-aid kit
• safety glasses and gloves for handling batteries
• at least two (2) hazard warning cones
• two (2) yellow warning flags, minimum size 300 mm x 300 mm
• suitable fire extinguishers
• fire blankets
• sand (or similar material) for extinguishing fires
• a spade
• suitable containers for damaged electrochemical cells
• safety vests
• two (2) whistles
• a back-pack fire extinguisher, filled with at least 16 litres of water, for fighting grass
fires.
3.6 Support vehicles
3.6.1 Each Team must supply a front and a rear escort vehicle, a means of transporting the
Competition Vehicle, and sufficient additional vehicles to transport and support the Team
and its equipment during the Event.
3.6.2 The minimum requirement for transporting the Competition Vehicle is a suitable truck or
trailer, which must accompany the Team throughout the journey.
Many vehicle rental companies in Australia require the hirer and all drivers to be at least 23 years of age.
One-way interstate rentals might not be possible through an airport rental desk and might require head office
approval. Trailers should be booked early.
49
3.6.3 Each Competition Vehicle must, at all times when in motion on the route, be
accompanied by a front escort vehicle in front of the Competition Vehicle and a rear
escort vehicle behind the Competition Vehicle. The space between the front escort
vehicle and the Competition Vehicle should not be occupied by any other team vehicles
except when those vehicles are overtaking, or being overtaking by, the Competition
Vehicle. The space between the Competition Vehicle and the rear escort vehicle should
not be occupied by any other vehicles.
3.6.4 A minimum of two (2) drivers must be available for every vehicle associated with the
Team.
3.6.5 The rear escort vehicle must not be a bus, truck, or large campervan, or be towing a
trailer.
If traffic approaching from behind sees a large vehicle with a flashing light, the immediate perception is that
that vehicle itself is the hazard, not the Competition Vehicle it is escorting. This may lead to a member of the
public overtaking a large rear escort vehicle only to encounter an unexpected and previously unseen
Competition Vehicle. Large rear escort vehicles make it difficult for vehicles approaching from the rear to
see the Competition Vehicle.
3.7 Escort vehicle signage
3.7.1 All Team vehicles must carry a sign, visible from 30 m to the rear, stating the name and
team number of the Team to which they belong.
3.7.2 All Team vehicles equipped with Citizen’s Band (CB) radio must carry a sign, visible from
30 m to the rear, advising the CB channel number in use.
3.7.3 A warning sign larger than 900 mm x 300 mm with black lettering on a yellow background,
clearly visible from 30 m, must be displayed on the rear of the rear escort vehicle, stating
CAUTION: COMPETITION VEHICLE AHEAD
3.7.4 No vehicle other than the rear escort vehicle may carry such a sign.
3.7.5 Front and rear escort vehicles must be fitted with amber flashing lights visible from all
directions at a distance of at least 200 m in daylight. Flashing amber lights must not be
obscured by signs or other equipment on the roof of an escort vehicle.
Beacons designed as warning devices for industrial equipment are unlikely to meet the visibility requirement.
3.8 Communication
3.8.1 Every Competition Vehicle must have means of two-way voice radio communication with
its rear escort vehicle. Communication must be possible whenever the driver is in the
Competition Vehicle, including when the main energy storage contactors are open and
when the Competition Vehicle is in safe state.
3.8.2 Each Team will be issued with a satellite telephone and external antenna. Further detail
will be provided in the Team Manager’s Guide.
50
3.8.3 Each Team will be issued with two 80-channel UHF CB radios, with antennas, to be fitted
into the front and rear escort vehicles. External antennas must be used to ensure that
the radio has sufficient range to communicate effectively with other road users. Teams
must monitor the channel they have been allocated at all times while on the road, and
respond promptly and courteously, in English, to reasonable communications with other
road users, Teams and officials.
3.8.4 The satellite telephone and the two 80-channel UHF CB radios, with antennas, are hire
items only and must be returned to the event. Details will be provided via Team Notice.
3.9 Heavy vehicles
3.9.1 Any Team operating or contracting a vehicle over 4.5 tonnes GVM or a passenger
vehicle with 12 or more seats must register the full details with the Event Organiser.
3.9.2 Compliance with Australian National Heavy Vehicle regulations concerning driving
hours, record keeping and fatigue management is mandatory.
3.10 Preparation and testing
3.10.1 The Event Organiser will provide facilities for team preparation and track testing of
Competition Vehicles at the Event Headquarters in accordance with the dates listed in
the Event Schedule.
3.10.2 All participating Teams must base themselves, and their Competition Vehicles, at the
Event Headquarters from Monday 11 August 2025.
3.10.3 The Event Organiser will appoint a paddock manager to supervise the preparation and
test facility. The directions of the paddock manager must be followed.
3.10.4 Australian workplace standards will apply to all event-related activities in Australia.
3.10.5 The Clerk of the Course may impose event penalties for breaches of speed limits or other
rules at the Event Headquarters.
3.10.6 No test driving is to be conducted in the paddock, car park or access roads.
3.10.7 The track must not be accessed without clearance from the track controller.
3.10.8 The Event Organiser will work with the relevant authorities to provide on-road testing
facilities. Detailed arrangements will be published in the Team Manager’s Guide or via a
Team Notice.
Teams who make direct contact with Australian road authorities delay this process.
3.10.9 Any Team driving a Competition Vehicle on a public road without a permit is liable to civil
penalties and exclusion from the Event.
3.10.10 The Event Organiser reserves the right to request a security deposit against damage,
rubbish removal or cleaning beyond reasonable expectations.
51
3.11 Team registration and scrutineering
3.11.1 All participants are required to attend with their Team to complete the registration
process and present their Competition Vehicle for the scrutineering process. The
scrutineering process is divided into static and dynamic operations.
3.11.2 Team registration and Static Scrutineering will take place at such place as determined
by the Event Organiser at the time and date described in the Event Schedule.
3.11.3 Teams must attend registration and Static Scrutineering with:
• the Team Manager, and an interpreter if required
• all Competition Vehicle drivers, with their driving licences
• any waiver documents required for participants under the age of 18
• original signed copy of the indemnity form

visible)
• the lockable box in which energy storage packs can be impounded where required.
3.11.4 Competition Vehicles must be transported to scrutineering on the trailer or truck that will
be used during the Event.
3.11.5 The Team Manager must attend all registration and scrutineering stations. A Team
Manager not proficient in English must provide an interpreter to accompany them always
during this process.
3.11.6 All team members must complete their online registration by signing in at registration.
52
3.12 Static scrutineering
3.12.1 Static Scrutineering will check for compliance with the Regulations and will include a
regulatory compliance and roadworthiness inspection by the Northern Territory Road
Transport Authority.
3.12.2 Qualification must be achieved in road-ready condition. Teams that do not present at
the designated time in road-ready condition may fail to qualify.
3.12.3 Up to seven (7) members of a team (including an interpreter and any Team media
personnel) may accompany the Competition Vehicle on the scrutineering floor. Team
members may be substituted between inspection stations.
3.12.4 Some dismantling (such as removal of the solar collector or top shell) may be required
to facilitate inspection of the following components:
• mechanical systems (including seats, tyres, brakes, and steering)
• electrical systems
• energy storage system.
3.12.5 Dismantling and reassembly of the Competition Vehicle when required to facilitate
inspection of the Competition Vehicle must be conducted (in the sole opinion of the Chief
Scrutineer) in a reasonable time.
3.12.6 Checks and inspections with the Competition Vehicle in a road-ready configuration will
include, but not be limited to:
• signage
• dimensions
• solar collector type and size
• egress—all Competition Vehicle drivers and passengers are required
• vision—all Competition Vehicle drivers are required
• lights, indicators and horn
• electrical compliance.
3.12.7 All energy storage devices must be declared at Static Scrutineering. Failure to declare
any energy storage device may lead to disqualification.
3.12.8 The mass of each Challenger or Cruiser vehicle driver and passenger, with helmet,
driving clothes and shoes, will be determined at Static Scrutineering. If the mass of a
driver or passenger is less than 80 kg, ballast provided by the Event Organiser will be
added to make up the difference. No credit will be given if a driver or passenger weighs
more than 80 kg.
Deliberate consumption of excessive food and drink prior to weigh-in is not in keeping with the spirit of the
Event and may be hazardous to the health of the individual.
Competition Vehicle occupants must wear similar clothes (including shoes) while driving as when they weigh
in.
53
3.12.9 Drivers and passengers may be re-weighed at any time during the Event. Changes in
weight considered unreasonable by the Chief Medical Officer will be referred to the Clerk
of the Course.
3.12.10 Non-compliance penalties may be imposed at the absolute discretion of the Chief
Scrutineer and may include failure to qualify. Penalties will be published.
3.13 Cruiser design judging
3.13.1 Cruiser judging, which will determine a design score for each Cruiser vehicle, will take
place in Darwin at a time and location to be confirmed in due course via a Regulation
Bulletin.
3.13.2 Cruiser Teams must prepare a 3-minute video and a brochure that describes their
vehicle, how it will be used, and how it addresses sustainability, mobility and energy
resilience. Each Team will present their video and their vehicle to a panel of Cruiser
Judges appointed by the Event Organiser. Teams must allow Cruiser Judges to get into
their vehicle to test the space and comfort.
3.13.3 The design score for each Cruiser vehicle will be determined by the Cruiser Judges.
Each Cruiser Judge will allocate a single score, between 0 and 100%, to each Team.
The final design score for a Team will be the arithmetic mean of the individual Cruiser
Judge’s scores. Cruiser Judges will be asked to consider:
• design innovation
• ease of access and egress
• occupant space and comfort
• ease of operation (driving and charging)
• versatility
• style and desirability
• suitability for the declared purpose
• environmental impact
• efficiency and convenience of the charging system.
Cruiser Judges will not be told how much weight to place on each of these criteria.
3.13.4 The design score for each Cruiser vehicle will provide a time advantage — see
Regulation 3.21.6.
3.14 Dynamic scrutineering
3.14.1 Dynamic Scrutineering exercises will test the speed, stability, and braking capability of
the Competition Vehicle, and will occur at the Event Headquarters or such other place
as determined by the Event Organiser.
3.14.2 Competition Vehicles must pass Static Scrutineering before presenting for any part of
Dynamic Scrutineering.
54
3.14.3 Figure-8 testing must be completed during Static Scrutineering week, prior to Saturday
23 August 2025.
3.14.4 The remaining Dynamic Scrutineering tests will be conducted on Saturday 23 August
2025. Attendance of Team Managers and drivers at a 07:00 roll call is mandatory.
3.14.5 Competition Vehicles must complete Dynamic Scrutineering in road-ready condition and
with occupants and ballast in place.
3.14.6 Cruiser vehicles must complete Dynamic Scrutineering with two seats occupied.
3.14.7 No Competition Vehicle will be given permission to start the Event until it has passed
Dynamic Scrutineering. Any vehicle failing Dynamic Scrutineering will only be permitted
to re-present at the absolute discretion of the Chief Scrutineer. Dynamic Scrutineering
will close at 12:30 on Saturday 23 August 2025.
3.15 Modifications or changes after scrutineering
3.15.1 Once a Competition Vehicle and its drivers have passed Static Scrutineering, no
changes to the design or configuration of the vehicle (that is, to any items described in
the compulsory documentation) or changes to drivers will be permitted except under
exceptional circumstances approved by the Chief Scrutineer.

energy storage system unless it would be unsafe to leave them in. Cells removed must
be replaced by ballast with mass greater than the mass of the removed cells.
3.19.4 If a Competition Vehicle is unable to continue because too many energy storage cells
have been damaged then the Team may replace cells and continue but will be
considered no longer competing.
3.19.5 Each day, Cruiser teams may recharge their Competition Vehicles using their recharging
system before commencing driving for the day and after finishing driving for the day.
Once a Cruiser team has started driving on any day, they may not recharge until they
have finished driving for the day.

3.21.4 A time penalty of one minute will be imposed for each minute taken past the official daily
finish time, up to and including 10 minutes past the official finish time. Beyond 10
minutes, each additional minute will attract a penalty of two minutes. Competition
Vehicles must not be driven after sunset. Time penalties incurred in this manner will
determine an adjustment of the official start time the following day.
Example: If a team finishes at 17:07 on Day 2, the official start time for Day 3 will be adjusted to 08:07. If a
team finishes at 17:13 on Day 2, the official start time for Day 3 will be adjusted by 1 × 10 + 2 × 3 minutes
to 08:16.
3.21.5 A Competition Vehicle starting before its official start time will be subject to a penalty of
2 minutes for each offending minute.
3.21.6 After completing the control stop at Katherine, each Cruiser team will be released from
Katherine after a duration designed to give a time advantage to teams with high design
scores. The holding duration for each Cruiser team, in minutes, will be calculated by the
formula
𝑑𝑑 = 300(𝑠𝑠∗ − 𝑠𝑠)/𝑠𝑠∗
where 𝑠𝑠 is the team’s design score and s∗ is the maximum design score of any Cruiser
team. Teams still at Katherine at the end of day 1 will be allowed to depart at 08:00 on
day 2.
